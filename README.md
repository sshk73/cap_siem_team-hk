Project title:  Enhanced Cyber Security Monitoring: A SIEM Approach with ELK Stack, Kafka and Wireshark

The project is a cyber security project integrating tools such as Apache kafka, ELK stack and Wireshark.
The idea behind this project is to understand network security and detect anomalies. 
In this project we are going to use Apache Kafka to build data pipelines to handle large volumes of data,
Wireshark to capture and analyse the network traffic and ELK stack to manage the network traffic data 
and handle big datasets and complex queries. 
By combining these tools, we aim to build a SIEM system (Security Information and event management system).
SIEM systems are used to detect, analyse and respond to the anomalies or security threats of a network. 

Business Need: Explain the business or societal need that your project addresses.
There are many SIEM systems and the popular ones are splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight, Microsoft Sentinel
and AllenVault(AT&T). The SIEM system is used to help organizations to detect,analyse 
and  respond to the anomalies and also ensure the security policies of the organization are being enforced.
With the help of this system we can identify potential weaknesses and take preventive measures.



Problem Statement

We are in a digital age where many organisations are prone to cyber security threats
such as data breaches and other malicious activities. It is important to monitor and 
manage these threats as it is necessary for the organisations to implement security measures
to protect their confidential data. So we aim to develop a security information and event management system(siem system)
which helps us in a better understanding of the network, security and 
we will be able to detect, analyze and respond to the anomalies and 
take preemptive measures by identifying the potential weaknesses.
